# About me
## Little bit about me
My name is [Violeta Skripachova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/violeta-skripachova-015a60227).
My life wasn’t connected with IT before, just around 2 years ago, after pandemic started, I realized how IT world is expanding.
I just started thinking that if I will change my job, then & only to try IT.
It is unlimited space for learning something new, for new technologies, for self-development. 
I’m finished course Introduction of Quality Assurance - Manual testing via Java Guru school and decide to go further.
I’m working as Quality Manager & Crew Operator in Crew Manning Agency for already 7 years.
We are selecting, recruiting seafarers for our Clients - Shipowners already for 20 years.
But I’m not only working all the time, I have also a few hobbies.
My first passion is photography. During years it became as professional hobby, which brings money to my budget. :heart_eyes:
During wintertime my next hobby is snowboarding, and it a pity, that our country doesn’t have mountains & our entertainment is quite limited because of weather.
For summertime and for last 4 years, or something like this, my hobby is motorcycling.
And of course, traveling is my passion. I’m in love to sea new places, to communicate with people living with other standards.
Travel broadens the mind.
That is my small about me story as it should be here and should contain at least 200 words.
